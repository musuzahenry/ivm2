The seven major continuous visions that came to me one Sunday morning in June, 1933. 
The Lord Jesus spoke to me and said that the coming of the Lord was drawing nigh, 
but that before He came, seven major events would transpire. I wrote them all down and 
that morning I gave forth the revelation of the Lord.

 <h2>i. The First Vision</h2>
 Was that Mussolini would invade Ethiopia and that nation would "fall at his steps". 
That vision surely did cause some repercussions, and some were very angry when I said it 
and would not believe it. But it happened that way. He just walked in there with his modern 
arms and took over. The natives didn't have a chance. But the vision also said that Mussolini 
would come to a horrible end with his own people turning on him. That came to pass just 
exactly as it was said.

 <h2>ii. The Second Vision</h2>
 Foretold that an Austrian by the name of Adolph Hitler would rise up as dictator over 
Germany, and that he would draw the world into war. It showed the Siegfried line and
 how our troops would have a terrible time to overcome it. Then it showed that Hitler 
would come to a mysterious end. 

<h2>iii. The Third Vision</h2>
 Was in the realm of world politics for it showed me that there would be three great ISMS, 
Facism, Nazism, Communism, but that the rst two would be swallowed up into the third. 
The voice admonished, "WATCH RUSSIA, WATCH RUSSIA. Keep your eye on the King of the 
North."

<h2>iv. The Fourth Vision</h2>
 Showed the great advances in science that would come after the second world war. It was 
headed up in the vision of a plastic bubble-topped car that was running down beautiful 
highways under remote control so that people appeared seated in this car without a steering 
wheel and they were playing some sort of a game to amuse themselves.

<h2>v. The Fifth Vision</h2>
 Had to do with the moral problem of our age, centering mostly around women. God showed
 me that women began to be out of their place with the granting of the vote. Then they cut 
o their hair, which signi ed that they were no longer under the authority of a man but 
insisted on either equal rights, or in most cases, more than equal rights. She adopted men's 
clothing and went into a state of undress, until the last picture I saw was a woman naked 
except for a little g leaf type apron. With this vision I saw the terrible perversion and moral 
plight of the whole world.

<h2>vi. The Sixth Vision</h2>
 There arose up in America a most beautiful, but cruel woman. She held the people in her 
complete power. I believed that this was the rise of the Roman Catholic Church, though I knew 
it could possibly be a vision of some woman rising in great power in America due to a popular 
vote by women.

<h2>vii. The Seventh Vision:</h2>
Was wherein I heard a most terrible explosion. As I turned to look I saw nothing but debris, 
craters, and smoke all over the land of America.
 Now let me say this. Can anyone prove any of those visions wrong? Were they not all ful lled? 
Yes, each one has been ful lled, or is in the process right now. Mussolini invaded Ethiopia 
successfully, then fell and lost it all. Hitler started a war he could not nish and died 
mysteriously. Communism took over both the other two ISMS. The plastic bubble car has 
been built and is awaiting only a better network of roads. Women are all but naked, and are 
even now wearing topless bathing suits. And just the other day I saw in a magazine the very 
dress that I saw in my vision (if you can call it a dress). It was a plastic transparent type of cloth 
with three darkened spots that covered both breasts in a small area, and then there was a 
dark place like a small apron below. The Catholic Church is on the rise. We have had one 
Catholic president and will no doubt have another. What is left? Nothing except 
Hebrews 12:26. "Whose voice then shook the earth: but now He hath promised, saying, 
Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven." Once more God will shake the 
earth and with it shake everything loose that can be shaken. Then He will renovate it. Just last 
March, 1964, that Good Friday earthquake of Alaska shook the whole world though it did not 
unbalance it. But God was warning by a world tremor what He will soon do on a greater scale. 
He is going to blast and rock this sin-cursed world, my brother, my sister, and there is only one 
place that can stand that shock, and that is in the fold of the Lord Jesus. And I would beseech 
you while God's mercy is still available to you, that you give your whole life, unreservedly to 
Jesus Christ, Who as the faithful Shepherd will save you and care for you and present you 
faultless in glory with exceeding great joy.
