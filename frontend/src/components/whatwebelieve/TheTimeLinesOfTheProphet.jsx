                for kings and rulers and potentates. You will preach to multitudes the world over and 
                thousands will come to you for counsel. You must tell them that theirs thoughts speak 
                louder in heaven than their words. As the prophet Moses was given two signs to prove 
                he was sent from God, so you will be given two signs”.

                detect the presence of any germ caused disease by vibrations that will appear in your 
                left hand. Then you must pray for the person. If your hand returns to normal, you can

                anointing from God, do not try to think your own thoughts; it will be given you what to say.”

                to pass that you will be able to tell by vision the very secrets of their hearts. Then the 
                people will have to believe you. This will initiate the Gospel in power that will bring on the
